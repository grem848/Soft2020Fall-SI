# Homework Task

In the reality, servers often have to serve multiple clients at the same time.

Modify the program above, so then server would be able to listen to more than one clients in parralel, running multiple threads.

# How to

- open project and go to [/src/tcp](https://github.com/grem848/Soft2020Fall-SI/tree/master/P2/src/tcp)
- run [TCP.java](https://github.com/grem848/Soft2020Fall-SI/blob/master/P2/src/tcp/TCP.java) to run the server with multi-threading
- connect as client 1 using [TCPC.java](https://github.com/grem848/Soft2020Fall-SI/blob/master/P2/src/tcp/TCPC.java)
- connect as client 2 using [TCPC2.java](https://github.com/grem848/Soft2020Fall-SI/blob/master/P2/src/tcp/TCPC2.java)
- enjoy a server with two clients
